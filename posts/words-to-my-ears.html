With the pandemic continuing into a second year, schools moved once again to remote learning. This meant my wife, who is also a teacher, and I had to balance our remote teaching with our children's remote learning and still manage to keep the house and home running smoothly. I know we are not alone in this plight, so I am not complaining. I just wanted to share how I learned to cope with a bad situation. Audiobooks.</p> <p>I have been an on-again/off-again subscriber to <a href="https://www.audible.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Audible<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> since 2005, and while I have always enjoyed audiobooks, I initially found them to be a bit too expensive. As such, my library remained very small; I listened to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/161493.The_Hitch_Hiker_s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to Galaxy&quot;<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>, one of the first books I bought from Audible, so many times I could quote it word for word. But as I got older and money became less tight, I really began to appreciate listening to books. But then, I took it to the next level.</p> <p>In 2019, I set a goal for myself to listen to more audiobooks. My library had grown substantially by then, and there were many books I had yet to read. I was also unhappy with how much time I spent watching Netflix, and I thought books would be a good alternative. Plus, I could listen while cooking dinner or washing the dishes. So, I decided I would challenge myself to listen to 400 hours in a year. That is just over an hour a day, which in retrospect really isn't that much. But still, it was twice the number of hours from that past two years combined. To make it an added challenge, I would alternate between fiction and non-fiction, and I would only listen to books that I had not listened to before. By the end of December 2019, I had listened to just under 420 hours. I found a new enjoyment of listening to books and regularly listened to books whenever I could. However, this month, I made it an obsession.</p> <p>During my marathon listening sessions in 2019, I would average about 30 hours a month, with the highest being just under 50 hours. This month I listened to over 80 hours! That is an average of more than 2 1/2 hours a day, with some days being over 5 hours. However, unlike in 2019, I stuck to only fiction and mostly comedy starting with my favorite book of all time <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18616975-off-to-be-the-wizard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;Off to Be the Wizard&quot;<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>.
